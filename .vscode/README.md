# Data Structures Cheat Sheet
This repository contains implementations of common data structures in C Programming Language. Each data structure has its own folder, containing an implementation of the data structure.

## Data Structures
The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

### Array: 
A collection of elements, accessed by an index or a key<br>
### Linked List: 
A collection of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence<br>
### Stack: 
A collection of elements, with operations to add and remove elements from the top of the stack<br>
### Queue: 
A collection of elements, with operations to add elements to the back of the queue and remove elements from the front of the queue<br>
### Tree: 
A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes with a parent-child relationship<br>
### Binary Tree: 
A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children<br>
### Binary Search Tree: 
A binary tree data structure in which the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key<br>

#### Languages
The following programming language is used to implement the data structures in this repository:

C

#### Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you would like to contribute an implementation of a data structure in a programming language not currently represented in this repository, please open a pull request.
